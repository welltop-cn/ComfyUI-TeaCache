# ComfyUI-TeaCache

## Introduction
Timestep Embedding Aware Cache ([TeaCache](https://github.com/ali-vilab/TeaCache)) is a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps, thereby accelerating the inference. TeaCache works well for Image Diffusion models, Video Diffusion Models, and Audio Diffusion Models.

TeaCache has now been integrated into ComfyUI and is compatible with the ComfyUI native nodes. ComfyUI-TeaCache is easy to use, simply connect the TeaCache node with the ComfyUI native nodes for seamless usage.

## Updates
- May 22 2025: ComfyUI-TeaCache supports HiDream-I1-Full and redesigns TeaCache options:
    - It can achieve a 1.5x lossless speedup and a 2x speedup without much visual quality degradation.
    - Support HiDream-I1-Full LoRA!
    - Add start_percent, end_percent options and remove max_skip_steps option according to the feedback from [1](https://github.com/welltop-cn/ComfyUI-TeaCache/issues/112) and [2](https://github.com/welltop-cn/ComfyUI-TeaCache/issues/84).
    - Fix compatibility issues to match the latest official ComfyUI version.

## Installation
Installation via ComfyUI-Manager is preferred. Simply search for ComfyUI-TeaCache in the list of nodes and click install.
### Manual installation
1. Go to comfyUI custom_nodes directory inside ComfyUI
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
```
2. Clone the TeaCache repo and move into it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/welltop-cn/ComfyUI-TeaCache.git
cd ComfyUI-TeaCache
```
3. If you're using a virtual environment, activate it. Then install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### TeaCache
To use TeaCache node, simply add `TeaCache` node to your workflow after `Load Diffusion Model` node or `Load LoRA` node (if you need LoRA). Generally, TeaCache can achieve a speedup of 1.5x to 3x with acceptable visual quality loss. The following table gives the recommended rel_l1_thresh, start_percent and end_percent â€‹for different models:

If the image/video after applying TeaCache is of low quality, please reduce rel_l1_thresh. I really don't recommend adjusting start_percent and end_percent unless you are an experienced engineer or creator.

The demo workflows ([flux](./examples/flux.json), [pulid_flux](./examples/pulid_flux.json), [hidream_i1_full](./examples/hidream_i1_full.json), [hunyuanvideo](./examples/hunyuanvideo.json), [ltx_video](./examples/ltx_video.json), [cogvideox](./examples/cogvideox.json), [wan2.1_t2v](./examples/wan2.1_t2v.json) and [wan2.1_i2v](./examples/wan2.1_i2v.json)) are placed in examples folder.



### Compile Model
To use Compile Model node, simply add `Compile Model` node to your workflow after `Load Diffusion Model` node or `TeaCache` node. Compile Model uses `torch.compile` to enhance the model performance by compiling model into more efficient intermediate representations (IRs). This compilation process leverages backend compilers to generate optimized code, which can significantly speed up inference. The compilation may take long time when you run the workflow at first, but once it is compiled, inference is extremely fast. The usage is shown below:
